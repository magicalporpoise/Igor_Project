#You did great work today!
#I'm pleasantly surprised how many problems that 
#you were able to fix throughout the castle with 
#just your effort and determination.
#You will certainly be getting a raise.
#With your help I'll be able to show off my 
#creation TOMORROW instead of in a week.
#THANK YOU,
